jax.errors.SimplifiedTraceback: For simplicity, JAX has removed its internal frames from the traceback of the following exception. Set JAX_TRACEBACK_FILTERING=off to include these.
The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

TypeError: Scanned function carry input and carry output must have equal types (e.g. shapes and dtypes of arrays), but they differ:
  * the input carry component state.reward has type float32[] but the corresponding output carry component has type float32[3], so the shapes do not match
  * the input carry component state.metrics['distance_reward'] has type float32[] but the corresponding output carry component has type float32[3], so the shapes do not match
Revise the scanned function so that all output types (e.g. shapes and dtypes) match the corresponding input types.
